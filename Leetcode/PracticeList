There are 2 methods: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwQnydsKk_I>

Method - 1:
1. since we need to maaintain order from each character as is from master string - we need to maintain the position variable
2. start comparing slave string with master string by updating master string position.

Method - 2:
1. Map approach
2. find the keys occurance in the hash table with arrays
3. compare with them with slave string with position should be matched with master as is.
